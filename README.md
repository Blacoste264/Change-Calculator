Purpose of this project was to create a simple change calculator that can output total change due, as well as how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
Practice using modulo, attempting to create a responsive page, and getting familier with the DOM and returning items to HTML from Javascript. Created a drop down menu solely from JS.
